<h4> User Testing </h4>

    <p> For the user testing, I made a video demonstrating step-by-step process of my way of organizing earphones, and I also provided a supplementary booklet. During the user testing, I noticed that the users were struggling with flipping the pages of the booklet while they had earphones on their hands. </p> </div>

<h4> Final Product </h4>
<div>

  <p> After the user testing in class, I also tested my roommates and my friends outside of the class. They commented that the instructions in the booklet were more easily accessible than the video. I changed the format of the booklet to an instruction poster, so the users would not waste their time flipping through pages while they are learning. </p> </div>
