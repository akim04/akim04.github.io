   <h4> Idea Generations </h4>

  <div class="manual">
  <img src="images_master/iron_manual.jpg" />
  <p> This is a comic strip on how to iron a shirt with a hairdryer.</p>

  <img src="images_master/coffee_manual.jpg" />
  <p> This diagram demonstrates how to make a cup of coffee without using a coffee maker. </p>

  <img src="images_master/earphone_manual.jpg" />
  <p> This diagram demonstrates how to organize a set of earphones without getting them tangled. </p>

  <p>I could not decide which idea I should choose to work on. The class suggested either the hair dryer idea or the earphones idea would work well, and I eventually chose to demonstrate how to organize earphones.</p>

  </div>

<h4> User Testing </h4>
  <div>
    <img src="images_master/master_test.jpg"/>
    <p> For the user testing, I made a video demonstrating step-by-step process of my way of organizing earphones, and I also provided a supplementary booklet. During the user testing, I noticed that the users were struggling with flipping the pages of the booklet while they had earphones on their hands. </p> </div>

<h4> Final Product </h4>
<div>
  <img src="images_master/master_final.jpg"/>
  <p> After the user testing in class, I also tested my roommates and my friends outside of the class. They commented that the instructions in the booklet were more easily accessible than the video. I changed the format of the booklet to an instruction poster, so the users would not waste their time flipping through pages while they are learning. </p> </div>
