    <h4>Gil Elvgren's Pin-Up Paintings</h4>

    <p> For this Monograph project, I was inspired by Pin-up Girls painted by Gil Elvgren in the 40's through the 60's. </p>

    <p> I've been collecting images of Elvgren Pin-ups since the summer of 2012. I was attracted to his ways of showing female beauties &#40;which often are idealized and exaggerated in unrealistic ways&#41; in an aesthetically pleasing way, instead of making them look profligate. </p>

    <p> I had around 50 images when I started this project. As I researched more about history of pin-ups, I ended up having more than 300 images of Elvgren paintings. Then I categorized those images into several categories and sub-categories. Among those 300 images, I chose my 12 favorites to work with. </p>

<div class="Elvgren">
     <img src="images/pin_13.jpg" />
     <img src="images/pin_14.jpg" />
     <img src="images/pin_15.jpg" />
     <img src="images/pin_16.jpg" />
     <img src="images/pin_17.jpg" />
     <img src="images/pin_18.jpg" />
     <img src="images/pin_19.jpg" />
     <img src="images/pin_20.jpg" />
     <img src="images/pin_21.jpg" />
     <img src="images/pin_22.jpg" />
     <img src="images/pin_23.jpg" />
     <img src="images/pin_24.jpg" />
    </div>

    <p> I have always wondered why there is no such pin-up culture in Korea. And after the research, it is clear that white girls with blonde hair dominate in Elvgren's paintings. So I started this project with this question: How would Korean pin-up culture be presented if there is one? </p>
     
<h4>Oriental Pin-up Girls: the Red Book</h4>

    <p> I did photo-shoots of myself dressing in Korean traditional outfits and posing like Elvgren's pin-up paintings. &#40; The photo-shoot process was PAINFUL. Ugh. &#41; After taking photos, I used Photoshop to add traditional hair style and alter the colors of my only outfit. </p>

    <p> I wanted to make a book featuring these photos of Korean pin-up girls because it was the best way of communication of that time period. And I chose the color red for the cover because it has a connotation of being sensual and rated-R in Korea. The book is made to be viewed from right to left because that was the way how most Asian countries adopted for reading books. And since the purpose of pin-up is to take one's favorite photograph and "pin" it up on the wall or other surfaces, I made the images of pin-up girls detachable, making them available for pin-ups. </p>
