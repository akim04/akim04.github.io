    <h4>Starting with the Most Boring Fact about Me</h4>
    <p>For this assignment, we had only an hour to create a self-portrait of ourselves. I started brainstorming with the most "boring" and obvious fact of myself: I am from Southern California. Okay. So what about California is somewhat interesting? Oh, there is Disneyland in my neighborhood. But guess what, I do not like Disneyland despite the fact that it is well-known as "the happiest place on earth." I do not like how I have to wait in long lines for hours just to go on a 30seconds ride; I do not like how it is crowded everywhere. And everything is super overpriced. Seriously, three bucks for a tiny cup of ice cream? I would rather go to Target and buy a huge tub of ice cream with the same price. Anyway, I decided to draw my angry face using the Disney Logo.</p>

    <h4>Clean &amp; Clear</h4>
    <p>To improve my self-portrait, I used Adobe Illustrator to create a digital version. There is no significant changes, but I am satisfied with how it looks cleaner with sharper edges.</p>
