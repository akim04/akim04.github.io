     <p>For this assignment, I wanted to give my sister, who just started college this year, something special. When we were chatting on the phone last week, she was complaining how she cannot fit all her stuff in her backpack. She said she needs a bigger backpack. So I decided to make a backpack just for her!

    <p>The design of this backpack was inspired by Korean traditional Lucky Pouch. It is a Korean tradition to give Lucky Pouches to children on the New Year's day. I incorporated the design of the Lucky Pouch to wish my sister good luck with her new college life.
