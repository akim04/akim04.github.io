     <img src="images_loveletter/lee_2.jpg" />
     <p>My level of obsession is pretty high; it used to be even higher. I even Photoshopped my face onto his picture, and I put so much effort to make it look realistic. I&apos;m very proud of how it turned out.</p>

     <h4>More about Jae Hoon Lee</h4>
     <p>He is a Korean actor. He was born in 1984 July the Fourth. &#40;It's very easy to remember his birthday, right?&#41; He studied bioengineering in Korea University but he dropped out to pursue what he really wants to do. So he attended Korea National University of Arts and studied acting there. He started his career as an actor in 2005, and he officially debuted through the screen in 2007.</p>

     <h4>Reasons Why He Deserves My Obsession</h4>
     <p>First of all, obviously, he is handsome. If you think he is not handsome, well then, I will hate you forever. </p>

     <h4>It's Not Just About the Look</h4>
     <p>I am obsessed with him not just because of his physical attractiveness. I admire him as one of my role models. I briefly went over this, but he used to be an engineering student in one of the most competitive school in Korea. In his junior year, he decided to change his path because engineering was not what he really wanted to do. He had always been interested in acting since he was young, so he decided to study acting. Of course his parents were not happy with his decision of becoming an actor, but he put so much effort and tried hard to achieve his current status as an actor. I know some actors would choose the roles and would only take the main characters, but he would take any role that was offered to him, no matter how insignificant it was. All he concerned about was how much he could learn and improve on his acting, not so much about him becoming famous and making money. It is true that I was attracted to his appearance at first, but as I research about him more, I could relate to him more because I had a similar experience before I came to MICA. </p>

     <p>I was not pursuing art as my future career even though I was always interested in art. In my high school senior year, I applied to many schools as a non-art major, but I was not so sure about what to study in college yet. At the last minute, I wanted to take art seriously, so I came here. And even after I came here, I had hard time deciding my major. All I did was drawing and painting, and I never tried graphic design -I didn&apos;t even know what graphic design was. But I knew I was interested in marketing and advertising, and I heard that graphic design is somewhat related to my interests, so I took intro to graphic design as my elective in my freshman year, fell in love with it, and decided to study more about it. </p>

     <p>He made his final decision when he was a junior in college, and his effort is finally paying him off. I made my decision in high school, which is way earlier than when he did. So if I try my best just like he did, then who knows, one day I might become a famous graphic designer? He is a great role model, and he inspires me to work hard.</p>

     <p>One more thing to share: he likes to read! His favorite author is Yoshida Shuyichi, a Japanese writer. I like to read too and my favorite author is Kaneshiro Kazuki, another Japanese writer. Yes, we share a lot in common.</p>
